# TF Editor

TF Editor is the official tool for creating and editing custom songs for the VR game [Taiko Frenzy](https://taikofrenzy.glitchr-studio.com).
With the editor, you can import an audio file in **.wav** or **.ogg** format and place the various types of notes supported by the game for each desired difficulty level.
Upon completion, the software automatically generates a folder that you can place in the game directory to play with your own tracks.
